# The project
Welcome to the *sketch-curriculum-components* project! This project aims to create a responsive web page for presenting a curriculum vitae that can be hosted for free using GitHub Pages.

Click on the [link](https://gustavorizzo.github.io/sketch-curriculum-components/) to see the current state of the application, using my personal data as an example.

# Would you like to use?
Is it useful for you? Would you like to apply that in your own curriculum? Feel free to *clone* or *fork* it and use it however you prefer! üöÄ

To run the project locally, you will need to have *Node.js* installed on your machine. After installation, run the following commands:
```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```
To customize the web page content according to your needs, simply modify the contents of the [data.json](https://github.com/GustavoRizzo/sketch-curriculum-components/tree/main/src/data) file.

To use the free hosting provided by GitHub Pages, you will need to adjust some settings in your GitHub repository. I strongly suggest looking for tutorials on the internet for detailed instructions. However, once configured, the [workflow](https://github.com/GustavoRizzo/sketch-curriculum-components/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml) provided will automatically deploy the page whenever the main branch is updated.

I hope that helps you! Good luck!üòâüëç
